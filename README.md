# IOT-HSS

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **IOT-HSS** is an end-to-end setup that detects and reports safety-related events (e.g., fire, motion, gas leak) from **hardware sensors** to a **cloud-hosted dashboard**.
- Hardware sensors + ESP-01 module send alerts to a **local server**.
- Local server formats data and sends it to **Firebase Firestore**.
- A **Firebase-hosted secure web dashboard** shows real-time alerts.
- **Only authorized users** can access the dashboard.

## Components
1. **Hardware**
   - ESP-01 Wi-Fi module connected to safety sensors (smoke, motion, etc.).
   - Sensors trigger alerts â†’ ESP-01 sends data to the local server over HTTP.

2. **Local Server**
   - Runs on a PC/Raspberry Pi or other small host.
   - Receives HTTP requests from ESP-01.
   - Validates & formats the alert data.
   - Sends it to **Firebase Firestore** using the Firebase Admin SDK.

3. **Cloud Backend (Firebase)**
   - **Firestore Database** stores all alerts with timestamps.
   - **Firebase Authentication** protects access to the dashboard.
   - **Firestore Security Rules** ensure only logged-in users can read/write.

4. **Frontend Dashboard (Firebase Hosting)**
   - Displays latest alerts in real-time (sorted by newest first).
   - Allows login/logout using Firebase Authentication.
   - Only shows alerts to authenticated, authorized users.

## Features

### Hardware & Local Server
- Detects safety events from sensors.
- Sends data over Wi-Fi using ESP-01.
- Local server acts as a **bridge** between non-HTTPS ESP-01 and HTTPS Firebase.

### Cloud Backend
- **Firestore** real-time database for alerts.
- Secure read/write rules.
- **Authentication** (email/password) with pre-approved accounts.

### Web Dashboard
- Real-time alert updates without refreshing.
- Alerts sorted by timestamp (newest first).
- Zone and status displayed clearly.
- Mobile and desktop friendly.
- Secure login/logout.
- Prevents public access â€” **no open registration**.

## Hardware Setup
1. Connect your sensors to the ESP-01 module.
2. Flash ESP-01 firmware to:
   - Read sensor values.
   - Send HTTP requests to the local server's IP/Port.
3. Ensure ESP-01 can reach the local server via Wi-Fi.

## Local Server Setup
The local server:
- Runs on your PC or Raspberry Pi.
- Receives alerts from ESP-01 over HTTP.
- Sends formatted alerts to Firebase.
